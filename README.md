# Hotel Data From Across the World

##Working on Redesign Model.  Below plots are outdated

Data downloaded from Kaggle.com

Looking at some of the attributes of hotel bookings from across the world.
Some of the features include number of children, number of adults, location data, and lead time for bookings.

Plotted some of the relationships between the features to see is if there were any correlations.

Some of the obious is that during the summer/fall months, the number of weekdays stayed at the hotels is significantly higher, most likely due to those months being the vacation season.

Interestingly enough, there doesn't seem to be much of a correlation in number of adults/children compared to the leadtime.  Generally I would expect larger families needing to do more planning of hotel stays, but that doesn't seem to be supported by the data.

Another point, which seems like a logical conculsion is the distribution of the number of adults and children.  

The average number of adults is two and the average number of children is 1.  Leading to the conclusion that more than likely a booking
will be for a family with 1 child.

Also wanted to take at look at how meals and types of hotels had differing average daily rates throughout the month

And lastly wanted to put the meals, hotel type, and average daily rate into one plot to give a nice overall look at how these values compare.
